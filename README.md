# R-DHIS2
This repository is for R script I have written for downloading data from one DHIS2 instance to another. The DHIS2 instances will have different Data Elements and Category Combinations.
As usual, you will need to get the different data element and category combination ids from the instances you want to push data. Also get the organisation unit IDs. You will have to put work in setting up the correct data frame/table which will be used to generate the json code for upload.

Please feel free to comment and download the script
